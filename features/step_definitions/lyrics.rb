 I want you to know
 He's not coming back
 Look into my mouth
 I'm not coming back
 
 [Hook]
 So knives out
 Cut him up
 Don't look down
 Shove it in your mouth
 
 [Verse 2]
 If you'd been a dog
 They would have drowned you at birth
 Look into my mouth
 It's the only way you'll know I'm telling the truth
 
 [Hook]
 So knives out
 Cut him up
 Squash his head
 Put him in the pot
 
 [Verse 3]
 I want you to know
 He's not coming back
 His blood is frozen
 Still there is no point letting it go to waste
 
 [Hook]
 So knives out
 Catch the mouse
 Squash his head
 Put him in the pot"
